The 5x5x5 led cube using:
  * [Arduino Mega](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega) to directly control the 25 columns
  * 125 blue 1000mcd 5mm diffuse leds
  * ULN2803 to control the 5 layers


It also contains an PC-based cube editor based on the [Qube5-Editor](http://www.qube-solutions.de/qube-5/software/qube-editor) to edit and control the cube
